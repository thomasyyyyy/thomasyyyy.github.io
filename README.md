# [Project 1: Coffee company data analysis](insert_link)

#### **Project Overview**
The notebook is focused on analyzing a dataset related to a **coffee company** using Python, to generate insights to aid **business decision-making**. The analysis includes **sales performance across different quarters, regions, and product segments** to recommend whether certain products should be continued or discontinued.

#### **Key Objectives**
- Load and preprocess **Coffee_company dataset** using **Pandas**.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key sales trends.
- Generate insights into **product performance**, **regional sales**, and **segment-based profitability**.
- Make **data-driven recommendations** for business strategy.

#### **Key Findings**
- **Total revenue** across all products is **£14.78M**.
- **Highest sales** were recorded in **Q4 of 2019** with **£4.12M** in total revenue.
- **France** had the **highest** overall sales, generating **£3.32M**.
- **Coffee A** was the **best-selling product**, contributing **£4.8M** in revenue.
- **Coffee B** generated the **lowest revenue**, only **£1.83M** globally.
- **Government sector sales** were the most profitable, whereas **enterprise segment sales** showed negative revenue.

#### **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Loaded dataset using `pandas`.
   - Cleaned and formatted column names.
   - Displayed initial rows for preview.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Aggregated **sales figures** by **product, region, and time period**.
   - Created **quarterly sales trends** to identify seasonal patterns.
   - Analyzed **revenue contributions by segment** (e.g., Government, Enterprise).

3. **Visualization & Insights:**
   - Generated **bar charts and line plots** to highlight key sales trends.
   - Compared **sales performance** between different products and regions.
   - Evaluated which product lines should be **discontinued or expanded**.

#### **Technologies & Tools Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing & visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis.
- **GitHub Repository** for version control and portfolio presentation.

#### **Outcome & Business Recommendations**
- **Coffee A should be expanded** due to its strong sales performance.
- **Coffee B should be reconsidered** or **discontinued** due to poor revenue generation.
- The **Enterprise segment needs strategic intervention** due to **negative revenue trends**.
- **Seasonal trends should guide marketing efforts**, focusing on Q4 for maximizing sales.
